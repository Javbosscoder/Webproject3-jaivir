<!-- I chose a maroon and light beige colour scheme, which are both warm colours. 
Maroon is part of the red colour family. Red represents strength, tradition, and resilience I think this matches the spirit of Treaty 1. 
Beige belongs to the neutral colour family and is a calm, balanced background that makes the text easier to read. 
Together, Maroon and with beige it looks really pleasing and is I a good combo for Treaty 1 and  grade 9-12. -->

                    <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Treaty No. 1 was the first of the numbered treaties that helped establish Western Canada, and was made with the understanding that the Treaty would be in place for “as long as the sun shines, the grass grows and the river flows”. Indigenous peoples have lived on the land we now call Canada for thousands of years, with their own unique cultures, identities, traditions, languages and institutions. Treaties are agreements between the Crown and the First Nation signatories to establish how each would coexist within the territory of the treaty. Treaty No. 1 is the first in a series of 11 treaties made between 1871 and 1921.</p>
