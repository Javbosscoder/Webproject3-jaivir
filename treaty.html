                <p>Treaty 1 promised land, annuities, provisions, and rights to hunt and fish. It allocated 160 acres per family of five, offered annual payments, and provided agricultural tools, although many promises were underdelivered, leading to long-term grievances.</p>

This plaque honors the signing of Treaty No. 1 on August 3, 1871, the first of the 11 numbered treaties between the Canadian Crown and Indigenous peoples. The treaty was negotiated between the Crown and the Anishinaabe (Saulteaux) and Nehiyaw (Cree) peoples of southern Manitoba, including the area around the Forks at the Assiniboine and Red riversâ€”a vital trade and gathering site .">

                <p>As the first of the Numbered Treaties, Treaty 1 set the stage for future negotiations but had vague terms and unmet promises. The Treaty highlighted the growing tension between Indigenous rights and settler expansion in the region.</p>
